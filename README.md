# Algorithms in Java

This repository hosts my work-in-progress implementations of various basic and intermediate algorithms in Java. I will be following along the [Algorithm Design Manual](http://www.algorist.com/) by Steven Skiena all through 2017 and beyond. 

This repository is part of my study of algorithms &mdash; right from the basic insertion sort to things like computational geometry and combinatorics.
